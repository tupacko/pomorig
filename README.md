# Pomo Rig
Small, classical Pomodoro utility application with a nice and functional touch.

It has two simple functionalities:

1. Counts down from 25 minutes.
2. Can be minimized into a few pixels high progress bar docked at the top of the display.

Counting down always starts from 25 minutes. It can be reset as many times as you want. Also shows progress in color code for easier use. It is transitioning from green to orange-red. No need to always keep an eye on the numbers :)

It can be "hidden" so you can work in peace while still tracking your time. This, by the use of a narrow colored progress bar at the top of your display. Of course, after time's up, the application pops up in front of the other ones.

**What it has not?** Well, no logging, analytics, custom work and pause settings ... No sounds ... In general, nothing more than strictly needed.
